Thermal Conductivity Measurement Notes
========================================

Sample: Silicon Wafer A
Measurement Date: 2024-02-24
Operator: J. Doe

Equipment:
- 3-omega sensor configuration
- Temperature controller: Lakeshore 336
- Lock-in amplifier: SR830

Measurement Conditions:
- Ambient pressure: 1 atm
- Sample mounting: thermal paste (Arctic Silver 5)
- Heating current: 10 mA
- Frequency: 1 kHz

Temperature Range: 273-363 K
Number of points: 10
Dwell time: 300 seconds per point

Notes:
- Sample cleaned with acetone and IPA before mounting
- Thermal equilibration verified before each measurement
- Slight drift observed above 350 K, data recollected
- All measurements within expected uncertainty range

Data Processing:
- Background subtraction applied
- Curve fitting: polynomial order 2
- Uncertainty propagated from voltage and current measurements
